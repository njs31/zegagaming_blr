      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how ZEGA GAMING and its affiliates
        (collectively "ZEGA GAMING, we, our, us") collect, use, share, protect,
        or otherwise process your information/personal data through our website
        <a href="https://zegagaming.com/">https://zegagaming.com/</a> (hereinafter
        referred to as the Platform).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that you may be able to browse certain sections of the
        Platform without registering with us. We do not offer any product/service
        under this Platform outside India, and your personal data will primarily
        be stored and processed in India. By visiting this Platform, providing
        your information, or availing any product/service offered on the
        Platform, you expressly agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of
        this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, and the applicable service/product
        terms and conditions, and agree to be governed by the laws of India,
        including but not limited to the laws applicable to data protection and
        privacy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access our Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Collection</h2>
      <p>
        We collect your personal data when you use our Platform, services, or
        otherwise interact with us during the course of our relationship and
        related information provided from time to time. Some of the information
        that we may collect includes but is not limited to personal
        data/information provided to us during sign-up/registering or using our
        Platform, such as name, date of birth, address, telephone/mobile number,
        email ID, and/or any such information shared as proof of identity or
        address. Some of the sensitive personal data may be collected with your
        consent, such as your bank account or credit or debit card or other
        payment instrument information or biometric information such as your
        facial features or physiological information (in order to enable the use
        of certain features when opted for, available on the Platform), etc., all
        of the above being in accordance with applicable law(s). You always have
        the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular
        service or feature on the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may track your behaviour, preferences, and other information that you
        choose to provide on our Platform. This information is compiled and
        analysed on an aggregated basis. We will also collect your information
        related to your transactions on the Platform and such third-party
        business partner platforms. When such a third-party business partner
        collects your personal data directly from you, you will be governed by
        their privacy policies. We shall not be responsible for the third-party
        business partner’s privacy practices or the content of their privacy
        policies, and we request you to read their privacy policies prior to
        disclosing any information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive an email or a call from a person/association claiming to
        be ZEGA GAMING seeking any personal data like debit/credit card PIN,
        net-banking or mobile banking password, we request you to never provide
        such information. If you have already revealed such information, report
        it immediately to an appropriate law enforcement agency.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        We use personal data to provide the services you request. To the extent
        we use your personal data to market to you, we will provide you the
        ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal data to assist
        sellers and business partners in handling and fulfilling orders;
        enhancing customer experience; to resolve disputes; troubleshoot
        problems; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services,
        and updates; customise your experience; detect and protect us against
        error, fraud, and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and
        conditions; conduct marketing research, analysis, and surveys; and as
        otherwise described to you at the time of collection of information. You
        understand that your access to these products/services may be affected in
        the event permission is not provided to us.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We may share your personal data internally within our group entities, our
        other corporate entities, and affiliates to provide you access to the
        services and products offered by them. These entities and affiliates may
        market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-out.
        We may disclose personal data to third parties such as sellers, business
        partners, third-party service providers, including logistics partners,
        prepaid payment instrument issuers, third-party reward programs, and
        other payment methods opted by you. These disclosures may be required for
        us to provide you access to our services and products offered to you, to
        comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our user agreement, to
        facilitate our marketing and advertising activities, to prevent, detect,
        mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may disclose personal and sensitive personal data to government
        agencies or other authorised law enforcement agencies if required to do
        so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process.
        We may disclose personal data to law enforcement offices, third-party
        rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy;
        respond to claims that an advertisement, posting, or other content
        violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property, or
        personal safety of our users or the general public.
      </p>

      <h2>Security Precautions</h2>
      <p>
        To protect your personal data from unauthorised access or disclosure,
        loss, or misuse, we adopt reasonable security practices and procedures.
        Once your information is in our possession or whenever you access your
        account information, we adhere to our security guidelines to protect it
        against unauthorised access and offer the use of a secure server.
        However, the transmission of information is not completely secure for
        reasons beyond our control. By using the Platform, the users accept the
        security implications of data transmission over the internet and the
        World Wide Web, which cannot always be guaranteed as completely secure,
        and therefore, there would always remain certain inherent risks regarding
        the use of the Platform. Users are responsible for ensuring the
        protection of login and password records for their account.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Deletion and Retention</h2>
      <p>
        You have the option to delete your account by visiting your profile and
        settings on our Platform. This action would result in you losing all
        information related to your account. You may also write to us at the
        contact information provided below to assist you with these requests. We
        may, in the event of any pending grievance, claims, pending shipments, or
        any other services, refuse or delay the deletion of the account. Once the
        account is deleted, you will lose access to the account. We retain your
        personal data information for a period no longer than is required for the
        purpose for which it was collected or as required under any applicable
        law. However, we may retain data related to you if we believe it may be
        necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse or for other legitimate
        purposes. We may continue to retain your data in anonymised form for
        analytical and research purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You may access, rectify, and update your personal data directly through
        the functionalities provided on the Platform.

      <p>
        By visiting our Platform or by providing your information, you consent to
        the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and otherwise processing of
        your information on the Platform in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        If you disclose to us any personal data relating to other people, you
        represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to use the
        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You, while providing your personal data over the Platform or any partner
        platforms or establishments, consent to us (including our other corporate
        entities, affiliates, lending partners, technology partners, marketing
        channels, business partners, and other third parties) to contact you

        Officer at the contact information provided below. Please mention
        “Withdrawal of consent for processing personal data” in the subject line
        of your communication. We may verify such requests before acting on your
        request. However, please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be
        retrospective and will be in accordance with the Terms of Use, this
        Privacy Policy, and applicable laws. In the event you withdraw consent
        given to us under this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to restrict
        or deny the provision of our services for which we consider such
        information to be necessary.
